# Python Cheat Sheet

## Python Basics

### Math Operators

From **Highest** to **Lowest** precedence:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Operators</th><th>Operation</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>**</td><td>Exponent</td><td><code>2 ** 3 = 8</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>%</td><td>Modulus/Remaider</td><td><code>22 % 8 = 6</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>//</td><td>Integer division</td><td><code>22 // 8 = 2</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>/</td><td>Division</td><td><code>22 / 8 = 2.75</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>*</td><td>Multiplication</td><td><code>3 * 3 = 9</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>-</td><td>Subtraction</td><td><code>5 - 2 = 3</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>+</td><td>Addition</td><td><code>2 + 2 = 4</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Examples of expressions in the interactive shell:

    2 + 3 * 6

    (2 + 3) * 6

    2 ** 8

    23 // 7

    23 % 7

    (5 - 1) * ((7 + 1) / (3 - 1))

### Data Types

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Data Type</th><th>Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Integers</td><td><code>-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Floating-point numbers</td><td><code>-1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Strings</td><td><code>'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', '11 cats'</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

### String Concatenation and Replication

String concatenation:

    'Alice' 'Bob'

Note: Avoid `+` operator for string concatenation. Prefer string formatting.

String Replication:

    'Alice' * 5

### Variables

You can name a variable anything as long as it obeys the following three rules:

1.  It can be only one word.
2.  It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (`_`) character.
3.  It can’t begin with a number.
4.  Variable name starting with an underscore (`_`) are considered as "unuseful\`.

Example:

    spam = 'Hello'

    _spam = 'Hello'

`_spam` should not be used again in the code.

### Comments

Inline comment:

    # This is a comment

Multiline comment:

    # This is a
    # multiline comment

Code with a comment:

    a = 1  # initialization

Please note the two spaces in front of the comment.

Function docstring:

    def foo():
        """
        This is a function docstring
        You can also use:
        ''' Function Docstring '''
        """

### The print Function

    print('Hello world!')

    a = 1
    print('Hello world!', a)

### The input Function

Example Code:

    print('What is your name?')   # ask for their name
    myName = input()
    print('It is good to meet you, {}'.format(myName))

### The len Function

Evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in a string:

    len('hello')

Note: test of emptiness of strings, lists, dictionary, etc, should **not** use len, but prefer direct boolean evaluation.

    a = [1, 2, 3]
    if a:
        print("the list is not empty!")

### The str, int, and float Functions

Integer to String or Float:

    str(29)

    print('I am {} years old.'.format(str(29)))

    str(-3.14)

Float to Integer:

    int(7.7)

    int(7.7) + 1

## Flow Control

### Comparison Operators

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>==</code></td><td>Equal to</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>!=</code></td><td>Not equal to</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>&lt;</code></td><td>Less than</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>&gt;</code></td><td>Greater Than</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>&lt;=</code></td><td>Less than or Equal to</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>&gt;=</code></td><td>Greater than or Equal to</td></tr></tbody></table>

These operators evaluate to True or False depending on the values you give them.

Examples:

    42 == 42

    40 == 42

    'hello' == 'hello'

    'hello' == 'Hello'

    'dog' != 'cat'

    42 == 42.0

    42 == '42'

### Boolean evaluation

Never use `==` or `!=` operator to evaluate boolean operation. Use the `is` or `is not` operators, or use implicit boolean evaluation.

NO (even if they are valid Python):

    True == True

    True != False

YES (even if they are valid Python):

    True is True

    True is not False

These statements are equivalent:

    if a is True:
       pass
    if a is not False:
       pass
    if a:
       pass

And these as well:

    if a is False:
       pass
    if a is not True:
       pass
    if not a:
       pass

### Boolean Operators

There are three Boolean operators: and, or, and not.

The _and_ Operator’s _Truth_ Table:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Expression</th><th>Evaluates to</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>True and True</td><td>True</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>True and False</td><td>False</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>False and True</td><td>False</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>False and False</td><td>False</td></tr></tbody></table>

The _or_ Operator’s _Truth_ Table:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Expression</th><th>Evaluates to</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>True or True</td><td>True</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>True or False</td><td>True</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>False or True</td><td>True</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>False or False</td><td>False</td></tr></tbody></table>

The _not_ Operator’s _Truth_ Table:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Expression</th><th>Evaluates to</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>not True</td><td>False</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>not False</td><td>True</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Mixing Boolean and Comparison Operators

    (4 < 5) and (5 < 6)

    (4 < 5) and (9 < 6)

    (1 == 2) or (2 == 2)

You can also use multiple Boolean operators in an expression, along with the comparison operators:

    2 + 2 == 4 and not 2 + 2 == 5 and 2 * 2 == 2 + 2

### if Statements

    if name == 'Alice':
        print('Hi, Alice.')

### else Statements

    name = 'Bob'

    if name == 'Alice':
        print('Hi, Alice.')
    else:
        print('Hello, stranger.')

### elif Statements

    name = 'Bob'
    age = 5

    if name == 'Alice':
        print('Hi, Alice.')
    elif age < 12:
        print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')

    name = 'Bob'
    age = 30

    if name == 'Alice':
        print('Hi, Alice.')
    elif age < 12:
        print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')
    else:
        print('You are neither Alice nor a little kid.')

### while Loop Statements

    spam = 0

    while spam < 5:
        print('Hello, world.')
        spam = spam + 1

### break Statements

If the execution reaches a break statement, it immediately exits the while loop’s clause:

    while True:
        print('Please type your name.')
        name = input()
        if name == 'your name':
            break

    print('Thank you!')

### continue Statements

When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop.

    while True:
        print('Who are you?')
        name = input()
        if name != 'Joe':
            continue
        print('Hello, Joe. What is the password? (It is a fish.)')
        password = input()
        if password == 'swordfish':
            break

    print('Access granted.')

### for Loops and the range() Function

    print('My name is')
    for i in range(5):
        print('Jimmy Five Times ({})'.format(str(i)))

The _range()_ function can also be called with three arguments. The first two arguments will be the start and stop values, and the third will be the step argument. The step is the amount that the variable is increased by after each iteration.

    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
       print(i)

You can even use a negative number for the step argument to make the for loop count down instead of up.

    for i in range(5, -1, -1):
        print(i)

### For else statement

This allows to specify a statement to execute in case of the full loop has been executed. Only useful when a `break` condition can occur in the loop:

    for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
       if i == 3:
           break
    else:
       print("only executed when no item of the list is equal to 3")

### Importing Modules

    import random

    for i in range(5):
        print(random.randint(1, 10))

    import random, sys, os, math

    from random import *.

### Ending a Program with sys.exit

    import sys

    while True:
        print('Type exit to exit.')
        response = input()
        if response == 'exit':
            sys.exit()
        print('You typed {}.'.format(response))

## Functions

    def hello(name):
        print('Hello {}'.format(name))

### Return Values and return Statements

When creating a function using the def statement, you can specify what the return value should be with a return statement. A return statement consists of the following:

- The return keyword.
- The value or expression that the function should return.

<!-- -->

    import random
    def getAnswer(answerNumber):
        if answerNumber == 1:
            return 'It is certain'
        elif answerNumber == 2:
            return 'It is decidedly so'
        elif answerNumber == 3:
            return 'Yes'
        elif answerNumber == 4:
            return 'Reply hazy try again'
        elif answerNumber == 5:
            return 'Ask again later'
        elif answerNumber == 6:
            return 'Concentrate and ask again'
        elif answerNumber == 7:
            return 'My reply is no'
        elif answerNumber == 8:
            return 'Outlook not so good'
        elif answerNumber == 9:
            return 'Very doubtful'

    r = random.randint(1, 9)
    fortune = getAnswer(r)
    print(fortune)

### The None Value

    spam = print('Hello!')
    spam is None

Note: never compare to `None` with the `==` operator. Always use `is`.

### print Keyword Arguments

    print('Hello', end='')
    print('World')

    print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice')

    print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice', sep=',')

### Local and Global Scope

- Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.
- However, a local scope can access global variables.
- Code in a function’s local scope cannot use variables in any other local scope.
- You can use the same name for different variables if they are in different scopes. That is, there can be a local variable named spam and a global variable also named spam.

### The global Statement

If you need to modify a global variable from within a function, use the global statement:

    def spam():
        global eggs
        eggs = 'spam'

    eggs = 'global'
    spam()
    print(eggs)

There are four rules to tell whether a variable is in a local scope or global scope:

1.  If a variable is being used in the global scope (that is, outside of all functions), then it is always a global variable.
2.  If there is a global statement for that variable in a function, it is a global variable.
3.  Otherwise, if the variable is used in an assignment statement in the function, it is a local variable.
4.  But if the variable is not used in an assignment statement, it is a global variable.

## Exception Handling

### Basic exception handling

    def spam(divideBy):
        try:
            return 42 / divideBy
        except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            print('Error: Invalid argument: {}'.format(e))

    print(spam(2))
    print(spam(12))
    print(spam(0))
    print(spam(1))

### Final code in exception handling

Code inside the `finally` section is always executed, no matter if an exception has been raised or not, and even if an exception is not caught.

    def spam(divideBy):
        try:
            return 42 / divideBy
        except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            print('Error: Invalid argument: {}'.format(e))
        finally:
            print("-- division finished --")

    print(spam(12))
    print(spam(0))

## Lists

    ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']

### Getting Individual Values in a List with Indexes

    spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
    spam[0]

    spam[1]

    spam[2]

    spam[3]

### Negative Indexes

    spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
    spam[-1]

    spam[-3]

    'The {} is afraid of the {}.'.format(spam[-1], spam[-3])

### Getting Sublists with Slices

    spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
    spam[0:4]

    spam[1:3]

    spam[0:-1]

    spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
    spam[:2]

    spam[1:]

    spam[:]

### Getting a list Length with len

    spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'moose']
    len(spam)

### Changing Values in a List with Indexes

    spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
    spam[1] = 'aardvark'
    spam

    spam[2] = spam[1]
    spam

    spam[-1] = 12345
    spam

### List Concatenation and List Replication

    [1, 2, 3] + ['A', 'B', 'C']

    ['X', 'Y', 'Z'] * 3

    spam = [1, 2, 3]
    spam = spam + ['A', 'B', 'C']
    spam

### Removing Values from Lists with del Statements

    spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
    del spam[2]
    spam

    del spam[2]
    spam

### Using for Loops with Lists

    supplies = ['pens', 'staplers', 'flame-throwers', 'binders']

    for i, supply in enumerate(supplies):
        print('Index {} in supplies is: {}'.format(str(i), supply))

### Looping Through Multiple Lists with zip

    name = ['Pete', 'John', 'Elizabeth']
    age = [6, 23, 44]

    for n, a in zip(name, age):
        print('{} is {} years old'.format(n, a))

### The in and not in Operators

    'howdy' in ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']

    spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
    False

    'howdy' not in spam

    'cat' not in spam

### The Multiple Assignment Trick

The multiple assignment trick is a shortcut that lets you assign multiple variables with the values in a list in one line of code. So instead of doing this:

    cat = ['fat', 'orange', 'loud']
    size = cat[0]
    color = cat[1]
    disposition = cat[2]

You could type this line of code:

    cat = ['fat', 'orange', 'loud']
    size, color, disposition = cat

The multiple assignment trick can also be used to swap the values in two variables:

    a, b = 'Alice', 'Bob'
    a, b = b, a
    print(a)

    print(b)

### Augmented Assignment Operators

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Operator</th><th>Equivalent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>spam += 1</code></td><td><code>spam = spam + 1</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>spam -= 1</code></td><td><code>spam = spam - 1</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>spam *= 1</code></td><td><code>spam = spam * 1</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>spam /= 1</code></td><td><code>spam = spam / 1</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>spam %= 1</code></td><td><code>spam = spam % 1</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Examples:

    spam = 'Hello'
    spam += ' world!'
    spam

    bacon = ['Zophie']
    bacon *= 3
    bacon

### Finding a Value in a List with the index Method

    spam = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Fat-tail', 'Pooka']
    spam.index('Pooka')

### Adding Values to Lists with append and insert

**append()**:

    spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']
    spam.append('moose')
    spam

**insert()**:

    spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']
    spam.insert(1, 'chicken')
    spam

### Removing Values from Lists with remove

    spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
    spam.remove('bat')
    spam

If the value appears multiple times in the list, only the first instance of the value will be removed.

### Sorting the Values in a List with sort

    spam = [2, 5, 3.14, 1, -7]
    spam.sort()
    spam

    spam = ['ants', 'cats', 'dogs', 'badgers', 'elephants']
    spam.sort()
    spam

You can also pass True for the reverse keyword argument to have sort() sort the values in reverse order:

    spam.sort(reverse=True)
    spam

If you need to sort the values in regular alphabetical order, pass str. lower for the key keyword argument in the sort() method call:

    spam = ['a', 'z', 'A', 'Z']
    spam.sort(key=str.lower)
    spam

You can use the built-in function `sorted` to return a new list:

    spam = ['ants', 'cats', 'dogs', 'badgers', 'elephants']
    sorted(spam)

## Tuple Data Type

    eggs = ('hello', 42, 0.5)
    eggs[0]

    eggs[1:3]

    len(eggs)

The main way that tuples are different from lists is that tuples, like strings, are immutable.

## Converting Types with the list and tuple Functions

    tuple(['cat', 'dog', 5])

    list(('cat', 'dog', 5))

    list('hello')

## Dictionaries and Structuring Data

Example Dictionary:

    myCat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'disposition': 'loud'}

### The keys, values, and items Methods

values():

    spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}

    for v in spam.values():
        print(v)

keys():

    for k in spam.keys():
        print(k)

items():

    for i in spam.items():
        print(i)

Using the keys(), values(), and items() methods, a for loop can iterate over the keys, values, or key-value pairs in a dictionary, respectively.

    spam = {'color': 'red', 'age': 42}

    for k, v in spam.items():
        print('Key: {} Value: {}'.format(k, str(v)))

### Checking if a Key or Value Exists in a Dictionary

    spam = {'name': 'Zophie', 'age': 7}
    'name' in spam.keys()

    'Zophie' in spam.values()

    # You can omit the call to keys() when checking for a key
    'color' in spam

    'color' not in spam

    'color' in spam

### The get Method

    picnic_items = {'apples': 5, 'cups': 2}
    'I am bringing {} cups.'.format(str(picnic_items.get('cups', 0)))

    'I am bringing {} eggs.'.format(str(picnic_items.get('eggs', 0)))

### The setdefault Method

Let's consider this code:

    spam = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5}
    if 'color' not in spam:
        spam['color'] = 'black'

Using `setdefault` we could make the same code more shortly:

    spam = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5}
    spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

    spam

    spam.setdefault('color', 'white')

    spam

### Pretty Printing

    import pprint

    message = 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.'
    count = {}

    for character in message:
        count.setdefault(character, 0)
        count[character] = count[character] + 1

    pprint.pprint(count)

### Merge two dictionaries

    # in Python 3.5+:
    x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
    y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
    z = {**x, **y}
    z

## sets

From the Python 3 [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

> A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### Initializing a set

There are two ways to create sets: using curly braces `{}` and the bult-in function `set()`

    s = {1, 2, 3}
    s = set([1, 2, 3])

When creating an empty set, be sure to not use the curly braces `{}` or you will get an empty dictionary instead.

    s = {}
    type(s)

### sets: unordered collections of unique elements

A set automatically remove all the duplicate values.

    s = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4}
    s

And as an unordered data type, they can't be indexed.

    s = {1, 2, 3}
    s(0)

### set add and update

Using the `add()` method we can add a single element to the set.

    s = {1, 2, 3}
    s.add(4)
    s

And with `update()`, multiple ones .

    s = {1, 2, 3}
    s.update([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    s  # remember, sets automatically remove duplicates

### set remove and discard

Both methods will remove an element from the set, but `remove()` will raise a `key error` if the value doesn't exist.

    s = {1, 2, 3}
    s.remove(3)
    s

    s.remove(3)

`discard()` won't raise any errors.

    s = {1, 2, 3}
    s.discard(3)
    s

    s.discard(3)

### set union

`union()` or `|` will create a new set that contains all the elements from the sets provided.

    s1 = {1, 2, 3}
    s2 = {3, 4, 5}
    s1.union(s2)  # or 's1 | s2'

### set intersection

`intersection` or `&` will return a set containing only the elements that are common to all of them.

    s1 = {1, 2, 3}
    s2 = {2, 3, 4}
    s3 = {3, 4, 5}
    s1.intersection(s2, s3)  # or 's1 & s2 & s3'

### set difference

`difference` or `-` will return only the elements that are in one of the sets.

    s1 = {1, 2, 3}
    s2 = {2, 3, 4}
    s1.difference(s2)  # or 's1 - s2'

### set symetric_difference

`symetric_difference` or `^` will return all the elements that are not common between them.

    s1 = {1, 2, 3}
    s2 = {2, 3, 4}
    s1.symmetric_difference(s2)  # or 's1 ^ s2'

## itertools Module

The _itertools_ module is a collection of tools intented to be fast and use memory efficiently when handling iterators (like [lists](#lists) or [dictionaries](#dictionaries-and-structuring-data)).

From the official [Python 3.x documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html):

> The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.

The _itertools_ module comes in the standard library and must be imported.

The [operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) module will also be used. This module is not necessary when using itertools, but needed for some of the examples below.

    import itertools
    import operator

### accumulate

Makes an iterator that returns the results of a function.

    itertools.accumulate(iterable[, func])

Example:

    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = itertools.accumulate(data, operator.mul)
    for each in result:
       print(each)

The operator.mul takes two numbers and multiplies them:

    operator.mul(1, 2)

    operator.mul(2, 3)

    operator.mul(6, 4)

    operator.mul(24, 5)

Passing a function is optional:

    data = [5, 2, 6, 4, 5, 9, 1]
    result = itertools.accumulate(data)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

If no function is designated the items will be summed:

    5
    5 + 2 = 7
    7 + 6 = 13
    13 + 4 = 17
    17 + 5 = 22
    22 + 9 = 31
    31 + 1 = 32

### combinations

Takes an iterable and a integer. This will create all the unique combination that have r members.

    itertools.combinations(iterable, r)

Example:

    shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square',]
    result = itertools.combinations(shapes, 2)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### combinations*with*replacement

Just like combinations(), but allows individual elements to be repeated more than once.

    itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r)

Example:

    shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square']
    result = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(shapes, 2)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### count

Makes an iterator that returns evenly spaced values starting with number start.

    itertools.count(start=0, step=1)

Example:

    for i in itertools.count(10,3):
       print(i)
       if i > 20:
           break

### cycle

This function cycles through an iterator endlessly.

    itertools.cycle(iterable)

Example:

    colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'violet']
    for color in itertools.cycle(colors):
       print(color)

When reached the end of the iterable it start over again from the beginning.

### chain

Take a series of iterables and return them as one long iterable.

    itertools.chain(*iterables)

Example:

    colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue']
    shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square', 'pentagon']
    result = itertools.chain(colors, shapes)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### compress

Filters one iterable with another.

    itertools.compress(data, selectors)

Example:

    shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square', 'pentagon']
    selections = [True, False, True, False]
    result = itertools.compress(shapes, selections)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### dropwhile

Make an iterator that drops elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true; afterwards, returns every element.

    itertools.dropwhile(predicate, iterable)

Example:

    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]
    result = itertools.dropwhile(lambda x: x<5, data)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### filterfalse

Makes an iterator that filters elements from iterable returning only those for which the predicate is False.

    itertools.filterfalse(predicate, iterable)

Example:

    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    result = itertools.filterfalse(lambda x: x<5, data)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### groupby

Simply put, this function groups things together.

    itertools.groupby(iterable, key=None)

Example:

    robots = [{
        'name': 'blaster',
        'faction': 'autobot'
    }, {
        'name': 'galvatron',
        'faction': 'decepticon'
    }, {
        'name': 'jazz',
        'faction': 'autobot'
    }, {
        'name': 'metroplex',
        'faction': 'autobot'
    }, {
        'name': 'megatron',
        'faction': 'decepticon'
    }, {
        'name': 'starcream',
        'faction': 'decepticon'
    }]

    for key, group in itertools.groupby(robots, key=lambda x: x['faction']):
       print(key)
       print(list(group))

### islice

This function is very much like slices. This allows you to cut out a piece of an iterable.

    itertools.islice(iterable, start, stop[, step])

Example:

    colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue',]
    few_colors = itertools.islice(colors, 2)

    for each in few_colors:
       print(each)

### permutations

    itertools.permutations(iterable, r=None)

Example:

    alpha_data = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    result = itertools.permutations(alpha_data)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### product

Creates the cartesian products from a series of iterables.

    num_data = [1, 2, 3]
    alpha_data = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    result = itertools.product(num_data, alpha_data)

    for each in result:
        print(each)

### repeat

This function will repeat an object over and over again. Unless, there is a times argument.

    itertools.repeat(object[, times])

Example:

    for i in itertools.repeat("spam", 3):
        print(i)

### starmap

Makes an iterator that computes the function using arguments obtained from the iterable.

    itertools.starmap(function, iterable)

Example:

    data = [(2, 6), (8, 4), (7, 3)]
    result = itertools.starmap(operator.mul, data)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### takewhile

The opposite of dropwhile(). Makes an iterator and returns elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true.

    itertools.takewhile(predicate, iterable)

Example:

    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]
    result = itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x<5, data)

    for each in result:
       print(each)

### tee

Return n independent iterators from a single iterable.

    itertools.tee(iterable, n=2)

Example:

    colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue']
    alpha_colors, beta_colors = itertools.tee(colors)

    for each in alpha_colors:
       print(each)

    colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue']
    alpha_colors, beta_colors = itertools.tee(colors)

    for each in beta_colors:
       print(each)

### zip_longest

Makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with fillvalue. Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted.

    itertools.zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None)

Example:

    colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue',]
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,]

    for each in itertools.zip_longest(colors, data, fillvalue=None):
       print(each)

## Comprehensions

### List comprehension

    a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
    [i - 1 for i in a]

### Set comprehension

    b = {"abc", "def"}
    {s.upper() for s in b}

### Dict comprehension

    c = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5}
    {v, k for k, v in c.items()}

A List comprehension can be generated from a dictionary:

    c = {'name': 'Pooka', 'first_name': 'Oooka'}
    ["{}:{}".format(k.upper(), v.upper()) for k, v in c.items()]

## Manipulating Strings

### Escape Characters

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Escape character</th><th>Prints as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>\'</code></td><td>Single quote</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>\"</code></td><td>Double quote</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>\t</code></td><td>Tab</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>\n</code></td><td>Newline (line break)</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>\\</code></td><td>Backslash</td></tr></tbody></table>

Example:

    print("Hello there!\nHow are you?\nI\'m doing fine.")
    Hello there!
    How are you?

### Raw Strings

A raw string completely ignores all escape characters and prints any backslash that appears in the string.

    print(r'That is Carol\'s cat.')

Note: mostly used for regular expression definition (see `re` package)

### Multiline Strings with Triple Quotes

    print('''Dear Alice,

    Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burglary, and extortion.

    Sincerely,
    Bob''')

To keep a nicer flow in your code, you can use the `dedent` function from the `textwrap` standard package.

    from textwrap import dedent

    def my_function():
        print('''
            Dear Alice,

            Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burglary, and extortion.

            Sincerely,
            Bob
            ''').strip()

This generates the same string than before.

### Indexing and Slicing Strings

    H   e   l   l   o       w   o   r   l   d    !
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11

    spam = 'Hello world!'
    spam[0]

    spam[4]

    spam[-1]

Slicing:

    spam[0:5]

    spam[:5]

    spam[6:]

    spam[6:-1]

    spam[:-1]

    spam[::-1]

    spam = 'Hello world!'
    fizz = spam[0:5]
    fizz

### The in and not in Operators with Strings

    'Hello' in 'Hello World'

    'Hello' in 'Hello'

    'HELLO' in 'Hello World'

    '' in 'spam'

    'cats' not in 'cats and dogs'

### The in and not in Operators with list

    a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    5 in a

    2 in a

### The upper, lower, isupper, and islower String Methods

`upper()` and `lower()`:

    spam = 'Hello world!'
    spam = spam.upper()
    spam

    spam = spam.lower()
    spam

isupper() and islower():

    spam = 'Hello world!'
    spam.islower()

    spam.isupper()

    'HELLO'.isupper()

    'abc12345'.islower()

    '12345'.islower()

    '12345'.isupper()

### The isX String Methods

- **isalpha()** returns True if the string consists only of letters and is not blank.
- **isalnum()** returns True if the string consists only of lettersand numbers and is not blank.
- **isdecimal()** returns True if the string consists only ofnumeric characters and is not blank.
- **isspace()** returns True if the string consists only of spaces,tabs, and new-lines and is not blank.
- **istitle()** returns True if the string consists only of wordsthat begin with an uppercase letter followed by onlylowercase letters.

### The startswith and endswith String Methods

    'Hello world!'.startswith('Hello')

    'Hello world!'.endswith('world!')

    'abc123'.startswith('abcdef')

    'abc123'.endswith('12')

    'Hello world!'.startswith('Hello world!')

    'Hello world!'.endswith('Hello world!')

### The join and split String Methods

join():

    ', '.join(['cats', 'rats', 'bats'])

    ' '.join(['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon'])

    'ABC'.join(['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon'])

split():

    'My name is Simon'.split()

    'MyABCnameABCisABCSimon'.split('ABC')

    'My name is Simon'.split('m')

### Justifying Text with rjust, ljust, and center

rjust() and ljust():

    'Hello'.rjust(10)

    'Hello'.rjust(20)

    'Hello World'.rjust(20)

    'Hello'.ljust(10)

An optional second argument to rjust() and ljust() will specify a fill character other than a space character. Enter the following into the interactive shell:

    'Hello'.rjust(20, '*')

    'Hello'.ljust(20, '-')

center():

    'Hello'.center(20)

    'Hello'.center(20, '=')

### Removing Whitespace with strip, rstrip, and lstrip

    spam = '    Hello World     '
    spam.strip()

    spam.lstrip()

    spam.rstrip()

    spam = 'SpamSpamBaconSpamEggsSpamSpam'
    spam.strip('ampS')

### Copying and Pasting Strings with the pyperclip Module

First, install `pypeerclip` with pip:

    pip install pyperclip

    import pyperclip

    pyperclip.copy('Hello world!')
    pyperclip.paste()

## String Formatting

### % operator

    name = 'Pete'
    'Hello %s' % name

We can use the `%x` format specifier to convert an int value to a string:

    num = 5
    'I have %x apples' % num

Note: For new code, using str.format or f-strings is strongly recommended over the `%` operator.

### str.format

Python 3 introduced a new way to do string formatting that was later back-ported to Python 2.7. This makes the syntax for string formatting more regular.

    name = 'John'
    age = 20'

    "Hello I'm {}, my age is {}".format(name, age)

    "Hello I'm {0}, my age is {1}".format(name, age)

The official [Python 3.x documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=sprintf#printf-style-string-formatting) recommend `str.format` over the `%` operator:

> The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string literals or the str.format() interface helps avoid these errors. These alternatives also provide more powerful, flexible and extensible approaches to formatting text.

### Lazy string formatting

You would only use `%s` string formatting on functions that can do lazy parameters evaluation, the most common being logging:

Prefer:

    name = "alice"
    logging.debug("User name: %s", name)

Over:

    logging.debug("User name: {}".format(name))

Or:

    logging.debug("User name: " + name)

### Formatted String Literals or f-strings

Python 3.6+

    name = 'Elizabeth'
    f'Hello {name}!'

It is even possible to do inline arithmetic with it:

    a = 5
    b = 10
    f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.'

### Template Strings

A simpler and less powerful mechanism, but it is recommended when handling format strings generated by users. Due to their reduced complexity template strings are a safer choice.

    from string import Template

    name = 'Elizabeth'
    t = Template('Hey $name!')
    t.substitute(name=name)

## Regular Expressions

1.  Import the regex module with `import re`.
2.  Create a Regex object with the `re.compile()` function. (Remember to use a raw string.)
3.  Pass the string you want to search into the Regex object’s `search()` method. This returns a `Match` object.
4.  Call the Match object’s `group()` method to return a string of the actual matched text.

All the regex functions in Python are in the re module:

    import re

### Matching Regex Objects

    phone_num_regex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')
    mo = phone_num_regex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')
    print('Phone number found: {}'.format(mo.group()))

### Grouping with Parentheses

    phone_num_regex = re.compile(r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)')
    mo = phone_num_regex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')
    mo.group(1)

    mo.group(2)

    mo.group(0)

    mo.group()

To retrieve all the groups at once: use the groups() method—note the plural form for the name.

    mo.groups()
    area_code, main_number = mo.groups()

    print(area_code)

    print(main_number)

### Matching Multiple Groups with the Pipe

The | character is called a pipe. You can use it anywhere you want to match one of many expressions. For example, the regular expression r'Batman|Tina Fey' will match either 'Batman' or 'Tina Fey'.

    hero_regex = re.compile (r'Batman|Tina Fey')
    mo1 = hero_regex.search('Batman and Tina Fey.')
    mo1.group()

    mo2 = hero_regex.search('Tina Fey and Batman.')
    mo2.group()

You can also use the pipe to match one of several patterns as part of your regex:

    bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(man|mobile|copter|bat)')
    mo = bat_regex.search('Batmobile lost a wheel')
    mo.group()

    mo.group(1)

### Optional Matching with the Question Mark

The ? character flags the group that precedes it as an optional part of the pattern.

    bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)?man')
    mo1 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batman')
    mo1.group()

    mo2 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwoman')
    mo2.group()

### Matching Zero or More with the Star

The \* (called the star or asterisk) means “match zero or more”—the group that precedes the star can occur any number of times in the text.

    bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)*man')
    mo1 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batman')
    mo1.group()

    mo2 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwoman')
    mo2.group()

    mo3 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwowowowoman')
    mo3.group()

### Matching One or More with the Plus

While \* means “match zero or more,” the + (or plus) means “match one or more”. The group preceding a plus must appear at least once. It is not optional:

    bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)+man')
    mo1 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwoman')
    mo1.group()

    mo2 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwowowowoman')
    mo2.group()

    mo3 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batman')
    mo3 is None

### Matching Specific Repetitions with Curly Brackets

If you have a group that you want to repeat a specific number of times, follow the group in your regex with a number in curly brackets. For example, the regex (Ha){3} will match the string 'HaHaHa', but it will not match 'HaHa', since the latter has only two repeats of the (Ha) group.

Instead of one number, you can specify a range by writing a minimum, a comma, and a maximum in between the curly brackets. For example, the regex (Ha){3,5} will match 'HaHaHa', 'HaHaHaHa', and 'HaHaHaHaHa'.

    ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3}')
    mo1 = ha_regex.search('HaHaHa')
    mo1.group()

    mo2 = ha_regex.search('Ha')
    mo2 is None

### Greedy and Nongreedy Matching

Python’s regular expressions are greedy by default, which means that in ambiguous situations they will match the longest string possible. The non-greedy version of the curly brackets, which matches the shortest string possible, has the closing curly bracket followed by a question mark.

    greedy_ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}')
    mo1 = greedy_ha_regex.search('HaHaHaHaHa')
    mo1.group()

    nongreedy_ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}?')
    mo2 = nongreedy_ha_regex.search('HaHaHaHaHa')
    mo2.group()

### The findall Method

In addition to the search() method, Regex objects also have a findall() method. While search() will return a Match object of the first matched text in the searched string, the findall() method will return the strings of every match in the searched string.

    phone_num_regex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d') # has no groups
    phone_num_regex.findall('Cell: 415-555-9999 Work: 212-555-0000')

To summarize what the findall() method returns, remember the following:

- When called on a regex with no groups, such as \\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d, the method findall() returns a list of ng matches, such as \['415-555-9999', '212-555-0000'\].
- When called on a regex that has groups, such as (\\d\\d\\d)-d\\d)-(\\d\\ d\\d\\d), the method findall() returns a list of es of strings (one string for each group), such as \[('415', ', '9999'), ('212', '555', '0000')\].

### Making Your Own Character Classes

There are times when you want to match a set of characters but the shorthand character classes (\\d, \\w, \\s, and so on) are too broad. You can define your own character class using square brackets. For example, the character class \[aeiouAEIOU\] will match any vowel, both lowercase and uppercase.

    vowel_regex = re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]')
    vowel_regex.findall('Robocop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.')

You can also include ranges of letters or numbers by using a hyphen. For example, the character class \[a-zA-Z0-9\] will match all lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers.

By placing a caret character (^) just after the character class’s opening bracket, you can make a negative character class. A negative character class will match all the characters that are not in the character class. For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:

    consonant_regex = re.compile(r'[^aeiouAEIOU]')
    consonant_regex.findall('Robocop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.')

### The Caret and Dollar Sign Characters

- You can also use the caret symbol (^) at the start of a regex to indicate that a match must occur at the beginning of the searched text.
- Likewise, you can put a dollar sign ($) at the end of the regex to indicate the string must end with this regex pattern.
- And you can use the ^ and $ together to indicate that the entire string must match the regex—that is, it’s not enough for a match to be made on some subset of the string.

The r'^Hello' regular expression string matches strings that begin with 'Hello':

    begins_with_hello = re.compile(r'^Hello')
    begins_with_hello.search('Hello world!')

    begins_with_hello.search('He said hello.') is None

The r'\\d$' regular expression string matches strings that end with a numeric character from 0 to 9:

    whole_string_is_num = re.compile(r'^\d+$')
    whole_string_is_num.search('1234567890')

    whole_string_is_num.search('12345xyz67890') is None

    whole_string_is_num.search('12 34567890') is None

### The Wildcard Character

The . (or dot) character in a regular expression is called a wildcard and will match any character except for a newline:

    at_regex = re.compile(r'.at')
    at_regex.findall('The cat in the hat sat on the flat mat.')

### Matching Everything with Dot-Star

    name_regex = re.compile(r'First Name: (.*) Last Name: (.*)')
    mo = name_regex.search('First Name: Some Last Name: One')
    mo.group(1)

    mo.group(2)

The dot-star uses greedy mode: It will always try to match as much text as possible. To match any and all text in a nongreedy fashion, use the dot, star, and question mark (.\*?). The question mark tells Python to match in a nongreedy way:

    nongreedy_regex = re.compile(r'<.*?>')
    mo = nongreedy_regex.search('<To serve man> for dinner.>')
    mo.group()

    greedy_regex = re.compile(r'<.*>')
    mo = greedy_regex.search('<To serve man> for dinner.>')
    mo.group()

### Matching Newlines with the Dot Character

The dot-star will match everything except a newline. By passing re.DOTALL as the second argument to re.compile(), you can make the dot character match all characters, including the newline character:

    no_newline_regex = re.compile('.*')
    no_newline_regex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.').group()

    newline_regex = re.compile('.*', re.DOTALL)
    newline_regex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.').group()

### Review of Regex Symbols

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Symbol</th><th>Matches</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>?</code></td><td>zero or one of the preceding group.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>*</code></td><td>zero or more of the preceding group.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>+</code></td><td>one or more of the preceding group.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>{n}</code></td><td>exactly n of the preceding group.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>{n,}</code></td><td>n or more of the preceding group.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>{,m}</code></td><td>0 to m of the preceding group.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>{n,m}</code></td><td>at least n and at most m of the preceding p.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>{n,m}?</code> or <code>*?</code> or <code>+?</code></td><td>performs a nongreedy match of the preceding p.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>^spam</code></td><td>means the string must begin with spam.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>spam$</code></td><td>means the string must end with spam.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>.</code></td><td>any character, except newline characters.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>\d</code>, <code>\w</code>, and <code>\s</code></td><td>a digit, word, or space character, resectively.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>\D</code>, <code>\W</code>, and <code>\S</code></td><td>anything except a digit, word, or space acter, respectively.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>[abc]</code></td><td>any character between the brackets (such as a, b, ).</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>[^abc]</code></td><td>any character that isn’t between the brackets.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Case-Insensitive Matching

To make your regex case-insensitive, you can pass re.IGNORECASE or re.I as a second argument to re.compile():

    robocop = re.compile(r'robocop', re.I)
    robocop.search('Robocop is part man, part machine, all cop.').group()

    robocop.search('ROBOCOP protects the innocent.').group()

    robocop.search('Al, why does your programming book talk about robocop so much?').group()

### Substituting Strings with the sub() Method

The sub() method for Regex objects is passed two arguments:

1.  The first argument is a string to replace any matches.
2.  The second is the string for the regular expression.

The sub() method returns a string with the substitutions applied:

    names_regex = re.compile(r'Agent \w+')
    names_regex.sub('CENSORED', 'Agent Alice gave the secret documents to Agent Bob.')

Another example:

    agent_names_regex = re.compile(r'Agent (\w)\w*')
    agent_names_regex.sub(r'\1****', 'Agent Alice told Agent Carol that Agent Eve knew Agent Bob was a double agent.')

### Managing Complex Regexes

To tell the re.compile() function to ignore whitespace and comments inside the regular expression string, “verbose mode” can be enabled by passing the variable re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile().

Now instead of a hard-to-read regular expression like this:

    phone_regex = re.compile(r'((\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?(\s|-|\.)?\d{3}(\s|-|\.)\d{4}(\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*\d{2,5})?)')

you can spread the regular expression over multiple lines with comments like this:

    phone_regex = re.compile(r'''(
        (\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?            # area code
        (\s|-|\.)?                    # separator
        \d{3}                         # first 3 digits
        (\s|-|\.)                     # separator
        \d{4}                         # last 4 digits
        (\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*\d{2,5})?  # extension
        )''', re.VERBOSE)

## Handling File and Directory Paths

There are two main modules in Python that deals with path manipulation. One is the `os.path` module and the other is the `pathlib` module. The `pathlib` module was added in Python 3.4, offering an object-oriented way to handle file system paths.

### Backslash on Windows and Forward Slash on OS X and Linux

On Windows, paths are written using backslashes () as the separator between folder names. On Unix based operating system such as macOS, Linux, and BSDs, the forward slash (/) is used as the path separator. Joining paths can be a headache if your code needs to work on different platforms.

Fortunately, Python provides easy ways to handle this. We will showcase how to deal with this with both `os.path.join` and `pathlib.Path.joinpath`

Using `os.path.join` on Windows:

    import os

    os.path.join('usr', 'bin', 'spam')

And using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path

    print(Path('usr').joinpath('bin').joinpath('spam'))

`pathlib` also provides a shortcut to joinpath using the `/` operator:

    from pathlib import Path

    print(Path('usr') / 'bin' / 'spam')

Notice the path separator is different between Windows and Unix based operating system, that's why you want to use one of the above methods instead of adding strings together to join paths together.

Joining paths is helpful if you need to create different file paths under the same directory.

Using `os.path.join` on Windows:

    my_files = ['accounts.txt', 'details.csv', 'invite.docx']

    for filename in my_files:
        print(os.path.join('C:\\Users\\asweigart', filename))

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    my_files = ['accounts.txt', 'details.csv', 'invite.docx']
    home = Path.home()
    for filename in my_files:
        print(home / filename)

### The Current Working Directory

Using `os` on Windows:

    import os

    os.getcwd()

    os.chdir('C:\\Windows\\System32')
    os.getcwd()

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path
    from os import chdir

    print(Path.cwd())

    chdir('/usr/lib/python3.6')
    print(Path.cwd())

### Creating New Folders

Using `os` on Windows:

    import os

    os.makedirs('C:\\delicious\\walnut\\waffles')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path
    cwd = Path.cwd()
    (cwd / 'delicious' / 'walnut' / 'waffles').mkdir()

Oh no, we got a nasty error! The reason is that the 'delicious' directory does not exist, so we cannot make the 'walnut' and the 'waffles' directories under it. To fix this, do:

    from pathlib import Path
    cwd = Path.cwd()
    (cwd / 'delicious' / 'walnut' / 'waffles').mkdir(parents=True)

And all is good :)

### Absolute vs. Relative Paths

There are two ways to specify a file path.

- An absolute path, which always begins with the root folder
- A relative path, which is relative to the program’s current working directory

There are also the dot (.) and dot-dot (..) folders. These are not real folders but special names that can be used in a path. A single period (“dot”) for a folder name is shorthand for “this directory.” Two periods (“dot-dot”) means “the parent folder.”

### Handling Absolute and Relative Paths

To see if a path is an absolute path:

Using `os.path` on \*nix:

    import os

    os.path.isabs('/')

    os.path.isabs('..')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path
    Path('/').is_absolute()

    Path('..').is_absolute()

You can extract an absolute path with both `os.path` and `pathlib`

Using `os.path` on \*nix:

    import os

    os.getcwd()

    os.path.abspath('..')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path

    print(Path.cwd())

    print(Path('..').resolve())

You can get a relative path from a starting path to another path.

Using `os.path` on \*nix:

    import os

    os.path.relpath('/etc/passwd', '/')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path

    print(Path('/etc/passwd').relative_to('/'))

### Checking Path Validity

Checking if a file/directory exists:

Using `os.path` on \*nix:

    import os
    os.path.exists('.')

    os.path.exists('setup.py')

    os.path.exists('/etc')

    os.path.exists('nonexistentfile')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path
    Path('.').exists()

    Path('setup.py').exists()

    Path('/etc').exists()

    Path('nonexistentfile').exists()

Checking if a path is a file:

Using `os.path` on \*nix:

    import os
    os.path.isfile('setup.py')

    os.path.isfile('/home')

    os.path.isfile('nonexistentfile')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path

    Path('setup.py').is_file()

    Path('/home').is_file()

    Path('nonexistentfile').is_file()

Checking if a path is a directory:

Using `os.path` on \*nix:

    import os
    os.path.isdir('/')

    os.path.isdir('setup.py')

    os.path.isdir('/spam')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path

    Path('/').is_dir()

    Path('setup.py').is_dir()

    Path('/spam').is_dir()

### Finding File Sizes and Folder Contents

Getting a file's size in bytes:

Using `os.path` on Windows:

    import os
    os.path.getsize('C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe')

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path

    stat = Path('/bin/python3.6').stat()
    print(stat) # stat contains some other information about the file as well

    print(stat.st_size) # size in bytes

Listing directory contents using `os.listdir` on Windows:

    import os
    os.listdir('C:\\Windows\\System32')

Listing directory contents using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path

    for f in Path('/usr/bin').iterdir():
        print(f)

To find the total size of all the files in this directory:

**WARNING**: Directories themselves also have a size! So you might want to check for whether a path is a file or directory using the methods in the methods discussed in the above section!

Using `os.path.getsize()` and `os.listdir()` together on Windows:

    import os

    total_size = 0

    for filename in os.listdir('C:\\Windows\\System32'):
          total_size = total_size + os.path.getsize(os.path.join('C:\\Windows\\System32', filename))

    print(total_size)

Using `pathlib` on \*nix:

    from pathlib import Path
    total_size = 0

    for sub_path in Path('/usr/bin').iterdir():
        total_size += sub_path.stat().st_size

    print(total_size)

### Copying Files and Folders

The shutil module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders.

    import shutil, os

    os.chdir('C:\\')

    shutil.copy('C:\\spam.txt', 'C:\\delicious')

    shutil.copy('eggs.txt', 'C:\\delicious\\eggs2.txt')
       'C:\\delicious\\eggs2.txt'

While shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it:

    import shutil, os

    os.chdir('C:\\')
    shutil.copytree('C:\\bacon', 'C:\\bacon_backup')

### Moving and Renaming Files and Folders

    import shutil

    shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs')

The destination path can also specify a filename. In the following example, the source file is moved and renamed:

    shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs\\new_bacon.txt')

If there is no eggs folder, then move() will rename bacon.txt to a file named eggs.

    shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs')

### Permanently Deleting Files and Folders

- Calling os.unlink(path) or Path.unlink() will delete the file at path.
- Calling os.rmdir(path) or Path.rmdir() will delete the folder at path. This folder must be empty of any files or folders.
- Calling shutil.rmtree(path) will remove the folder at path, and all files and folders it contains will also be deleted.

### Safe Deletes with the send2trash Module

You can install this module by running pip install send2trash from a Terminal window.

    import send2trash

    with open('bacon.txt', 'a') as bacon_file: # creates the file
        bacon_file.write('Bacon is not a vegetable.')

    send2trash.send2trash('bacon.txt')

### Walking a Directory Tree

    import os

    for folder_name, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('C:\\delicious'):
        print('The current folder is {}'.format(folder_name))

        for subfolder in subfolders:
            print('SUBFOLDER OF {}: {}'.format(folder_name, subfolder))
        for filename in filenames:
            print('FILE INSIDE {}: {}'.format(folder_name, filename))

        print('')

`pathlib` provides a lot more functionality than the ones listed above, like getting file name, getting file extension, reading/writing a file without manually opening it, etc. Check out the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) if you want to know more!

## Reading and Writing Files

### The File Reading/Writing Process

To read/write to a file in Python, you will want to use the `with` statement, which will close the file for you after you are done.

### Opening and reading files with the open function

    with open('C:\\Users\\your_home_folder\\hello.txt') as hello_file:
        hello_content = hello_file.read()

    hello_content

Alternatively, you can use the _readlines()_ method to get a list of string values from the file, one string for each line of text:

    with open('sonnet29.txt') as sonnet_file:
        sonnet_file.readlines()

You can also iterate through the file line by line:

    with open('sonnet29.txt') as sonnet_file:
        for line in sonnet_file: # note the new line character will be included in the line
            print(line, end='')

### Writing to Files

    with open('bacon.txt', 'w') as bacon_file:
        bacon_file.write('Hello world!\n')

    with open('bacon.txt', 'a') as bacon_file:
        bacon_file.write('Bacon is not a vegetable.')

    with open('bacon.txt') as bacon_file:
        content = bacon_file.read()

    print(content)

### Saving Variables with the shelve Module

To save variables:

    import shelve

    cats = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']
    with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file:
        shelf_file['cats'] = cats

To open and read variables:

    with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file:
        print(type(shelf_file))
        print(shelf_file['cats'])

Just like dictionaries, shelf values have keys() and values() methods that will return list-like values of the keys and values in the shelf. Since these methods return list-like values instead of true lists, you should pass them to the list() function to get them in list form.

    with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file:
        print(list(shelf_file.keys()))
        print(list(shelf_file.values()))

### Saving Variables with pprint.pformat

    import pprint

    cats = [{'name': 'Zophie', 'desc': 'chubby'}, {'name': 'Pooka', 'desc': 'fluffy'}]
    pprint.pformat(cats)

    with open('myCats.py', 'w') as file_obj:
        file_obj.write('cats = {}\n'.format(pprint.pformat(cats)))

### Reading ZIP Files

    import zipfile, os

    os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip
    with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip:
        print(example_zip.namelist())
        spam_info = example_zip.getinfo('spam.txt')
        print(spam_info.file_size)
        print(spam_info.compress_size)
        print('Compressed file is %sx smaller!' % (round(spam_info.file_size / spam_info.compress_size, 2)))

### Extracting from ZIP Files

The extractall() method for ZipFile objects extracts all the files and folders from a ZIP file into the current working directory.

    import zipfile, os

    os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip

    with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip:
        example_zip.extractall()

The extract() method for ZipFile objects will extract a single file from the ZIP file. Continue the interactive shell example:

    with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip:
        print(example_zip.extract('spam.txt'))
        print(example_zip.extract('spam.txt', 'C:\\some\\new\\folders'))

### Creating and Adding to ZIP Files

    import zipfile

    with zipfile.ZipFile('new.zip', 'w') as new_zip:
        new_zip.write('spam.txt', compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)

This code will create a new ZIP file named new.zip that has the compressed contents of spam.txt.

## JSON, YAML and configuration files

### JSON

Open a JSON file with:

    import json
    with open("filename.json", "r") as f:
        content = json.loads(f.read())

Write a JSON file with:

    import json

    content = {"name": "Joe", "age": 20}
    with open("filename.json", "w") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(content, indent=2))

### YAML

Compared to JSON, YAML allows a much better humain maintainance and gives ability to add comments. It is a convinient choice for configuration files where human will have to edit.

There are two main librairies allowing to access to YAML files:

- [PyYaml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML)
- [Ruamel.yaml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ruamel.yaml)

Install them using `pip install` in your virtual environment.

The first one it easier to use but the second one, Ruamel, implements much better the YAML specification, and allow for example to modify a YAML content without altering comments.

Open a YAML file with:

    from ruamel.yaml import YAML

    with open("filename.yaml") as f:
        yaml=YAML()
        yaml.load(f)

### Anyconfig

[Anyconfig](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyconfig) is a very handy package allowing to abstract completly the underlying configuration file format. It allows to load a Python dictionary from JSON, YAML, TOML, and so on.

Install it with:

    pip install anyconfig

Usage:

    import anyconfig

    conf1 = anyconfig.load("/path/to/foo/conf.d/a.yml")

## Debugging

### Raising Exceptions

Exceptions are raised with a raise statement. In code, a raise statement consists of the following:

- The raise keyword
- A call to the Exception() function
- A string with a helpful error message passed to the Exception() function

<!-- -->

    raise Exception('This is the error message.')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<pyshell#191>", line 1, in <module>
        raise Exception('This is the error message.')
    Exception: This is the error message.

Often it’s the code that calls the function, not the function itself, that knows how to handle an expection. So you will commonly see a raise statement inside a function and the try and except statements in the code calling the function.

    def box_print(symbol, width, height):
        if len(symbol) != 1:
          raise Exception('Symbol must be a single character string.')
        if width <= 2:
          raise Exception('Width must be greater than 2.')
        if height <= 2:
          raise Exception('Height must be greater than 2.')
        print(symbol * width)
        for i in range(height - 2):
            print(symbol + (' ' * (width - 2)) + symbol)
        print(symbol * width)
    for sym, w, h in (('*', 4, 4), ('O', 20, 5), ('x', 1, 3), ('ZZ', 3, 3)):
        try:
            box_print(sym, w, h)
        except Exception as err:
            print('An exception happened: ' + str(err))

### Getting the Traceback as a String

The traceback is displayed by Python whenever a raised exception goes unhandled. But can also obtain it as a string by calling traceback.format_exc(). This function is useful if you want the information from an exception’s traceback but also want an except statement to gracefully handle the exception. You will need to import Python’s traceback module before calling this function.

    import traceback

    try:
         raise Exception('This is the error message.')
    except:
         with open('errorInfo.txt', 'w') as error_file:
             error_file.write(traceback.format_exc())
         print('The traceback info was written to errorInfo.txt.')

The 116 is the return value from the write() method, since 116 characters were written to the file. The traceback text was written to errorInfo.txt.

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<pyshell#28>", line 2, in <module>
    Exception: This is the error message.

### Assertions

An assertion is a sanity check to make sure your code isn’t doing something obviously wrong. These sanity checks are performed by assert statements. If the sanity check fails, then an AssertionError exception is raised. In code, an assert statement consists of the following:

- The assert keyword
- A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False)
- A comma
- A string to display when the condition is False

<!-- -->

    pod_bay_door_status = 'open'

    assert pod_bay_door_status == 'open', 'The pod bay doors need to be "open".'

    pod_bay_door_status = 'I\'m sorry, Dave. I\'m afraid I can\'t do that.'

    assert pod_bay_door_status == 'open', 'The pod bay doors need to be "open".'

In plain English, an assert statement says, “I assert that this condition holds true, and if not, there is a bug somewhere in the program.” Unlike exceptions, your code should not handle assert statements with try and except; if an assert fails, your program should crash. By failing fast like this, you shorten the time between the original cause of the bug and when you first notice the bug. This will reduce the amount of code you will have to check before finding the code that’s causing the bug.

Disabling Assertions

Assertions can be disabled by passing the -O option when running Python.

### Logging

To enable the logging module to display log messages on your screen as your program runs, copy the following to the top of your program (but under the \#! python shebang line):

    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=' %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s- %(message)s')

Say you wrote a function to calculate the factorial of a number. In mathematics, factorial 4 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4, or 24. Factorial 7 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7, or 5,040. Open a new file editor window and enter the following code. It has a bug in it, but you will also enter several log messages to help yourself figure out what is going wrong. Save the program as factorialLog.py.

    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=' %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s- %(message)s')

    logging.debug('Start of program')

    def factorial(n):

        logging.debug('Start of factorial(%s)' % (n))
        total = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total *= i
            logging.debug('i is ' + str(i) + ', total is ' + str(total))

        logging.debug('End of factorial(%s)' % (n))

        return total

    print(factorial(5))
    logging.debug('End of program')

### Logging Levels

Logging levels provide a way to categorize your log messages by importance. There are five logging levels, described in Table 10-1 from least to most important. Messages can be logged at each level using a different logging function.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Level</th><th>Logging Function</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>DEBUG</code></td><td><code>logging.debug()</code></td><td>The lowest level. Used for small details. Usually you care about these messages only when diagnosing problems.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>INFO</code></td><td><code>logging.info()</code></td><td>Used to record information on general events in your program or confirm that things are working at their point in the program.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>WARNING</code></td><td><code>logging.warning()</code></td><td>Used to indicate a potential problem that doesn’t prevent the program from working but might do so in the future.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>ERROR</code></td><td><code>logging.error()</code></td><td>Used to record an error that caused the program to fail to do something.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>CRITICAL</code></td><td><code>logging.critical()</code></td><td>The highest level. Used to indicate a fatal error that has caused or is about to cause the program to stop running entirely.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Disabling Logging

After you’ve debugged your program, you probably don’t want all these log messages cluttering the screen. The logging.disable() function disables these so that you don’t have to go into your program and remove all the logging calls by hand.

    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=' %(asctime)s -%(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    logging.critical('Critical error! Critical error!')
    logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)
    logging.critical('Critical error! Critical error!')
    logging.error('Error! Error!')

### Logging to a File

Instead of displaying the log messages to the screen, you can write them to a text file. The logging.basicConfig() function takes a filename keyword argument, like so:

    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(filename='myProgramLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

## Lambda Functions

This function:

    def add(x, y):
            return x + y

    add(5, 3)

Is equivalent to the _lambda_ function:

    add = lambda x, y: x + y
    add(5, 3)

It's not even need to bind it to a name like add before:

    (lambda x, y: x + y)(5, 3)

Like regular nested functions, lambdas also work as lexical closures:

    def make_adder(n):
            return lambda x: x + n

    plus_3 = make_adder(3)
    plus_5(4)

Note: lambda can only evaluate an expression, like a single line of code.

## Ternary Conditional Operator

Many programming languages have a ternary operator, which define a conditional expression. The most common usage is to make a terse simple conditional assignment statement. In other words, it offers one-line code to evaluate the first expression if the condition is true, otherwise it evaluates the second expression.

    <expression1> if <condition> else <expression2>

Example:

    age = 15

    print('kid' if age < 18 else 'adult')

Ternary operators can be changed:

    age = 15
    print('kid' if age < 13 else 'teenager' if age < 18 else 'adult')

The code above is equivalent to:

    if age < 18:
        if age < 12:
            print('kid')
        else:
            print('teenager')
    else:
        print('adult')

## args and kwargs

The names `args and kwargs` are arbitrary - the important thing are the `*` and `**` operators. They can mean:

1.  In a function declaration, `*` means “pack all remaining positional arguments into a tuple named `<name>`”, while `**` is the same for keyword arguments (except it uses a dictionary, not a tuple).
2.  In a function call, `*` means “unpack tuple or list named `<name>` to positional arguments at this position”, while `**` is the same for keyword arguments.

For example you can make a function that you can use to call any other function, no matter what parameters it has:

    def forward(f, *args, **kwargs):
        return f(*args, **kwargs)

Inside forward, args is a tuple (of all positional arguments except the first one, because we specified it - the f), kwargs is a dict. Then we call f and unpack them so they become normal arguments to f.

You use `*args` when you have an indefinite amount of positional arguments.

    def fruits(*args):
       for fruit in args:
          print(fruit)

    fruits("apples", "bananas", "grapes")

Similarly, you use `**kwargs` when you have an indefinite number of keyword arguments.

    def fruit(**kwargs):
       for key, value in kwargs.items():
           print("{0}: {1}".format(key, value))

    fruit(name = "apple", color = "red")

    def show(arg1, arg2, *args, kwarg1=None, kwarg2=None, **kwargs):
      print(arg1)
      print(arg2)
      print(args)
      print(kwarg1)
      print(kwarg2)
      print(kwargs)

    data1 = [1,2,3]
    data2 = [4,5,6]
    data3 = {'a':7,'b':8,'c':9}

    show(*data1,*data2, kwarg1="python",kwarg2="cheatsheet",**data3)

    show(*data1, *data2, **data3)

If you do not specify \*\* for kwargs

    show(*data1, *data2, *data3)

### Thinks to Remember(args)

1.  Functions can accept a variable number of positional arguments by using `*args` in the def statement.
2.  You can use the items from a sequence as the positional arguments for a function with the `*` operator.
3.  Using the `*` operator with a generator may cause your program to run out of memory and crash.
4.  Adding new positional parameters to functions that accept `*args` can introduce hard-to-find bugs.

### Thinks to remember(kwargs)

1.  Function arguments can be specified by position or by keyword.
2.  Keywords make it clear what the purpose of each argument is when it would be confusing with only positional arguments.
3.  Keyword arguments with default values make it easy to add new behaviors to a function, especially when the function has existing callers.
4.  Optional keyword arguments should always be passed by keyword instead of by position.

## Context Manager

While Python's context managers are widely used, few understand the purpose behind their use. These statements, commonly used with reading and writing files, assist the application in conserving system memory and improve resource management by ensuring specific resources are only in use for certain processes.

### with statement

A context manager is an object that is notified when a context (a block of code) starts and ends. You commonly use one with the with statement. It takes care of the notifying.

For example, file objects are context managers. When a context ends, the file object is closed automatically:

    with open(filename) as f:
        file_contents = f.read()

    # the open_file object has automatically been closed.

Anything that ends execution of the block causes the context manager's exit method to be called. This includes exceptions, and can be useful when an error causes you to prematurely exit from an open file or connection. Exiting a script without properly closing files/connections is a bad idea, that may cause data loss or other problems. By using a context manager you can ensure that precautions are always taken to prevent damage or loss in this way.

### Writing your own contextmanager using generator syntax

It is also possible to write a context manager using generator syntax thanks to the `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator:

    import contextlib

    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def context_manager(num):
        print('Enter')
        yield num + 1
        print('Exit')
    with context_manager(2) as cm:
        # the following instructions are run when the 'yield' point of the context
        # manager is reached.
        # 'cm' will have the value that was yielded
        print('Right in the middle with cm = {}'.format(cm))

## `__main__` Top-level script environment

`__main__` is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A module’s **name** is set equal to `__main__` when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.

A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope by checking its own `__name__`, which allows a common idiom for conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script or with `python -m` but not when it is imported:

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # execute only if run as a script
        main()

For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a **main**.py module, the contents of which will be executed when the module is run with -m.

For example we are developing script which is designed to be used as module, we should do:

    # Python program to execute function directly
    def add(a, b):
        return a+b

    add(10, 20) # we can test it by calling the function save it as calculate.py

    # Now if we want to use that module by importing we have to comment out our call,
    # Instead we can write like this in calculate.py
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        add(3, 5)

    import calculate

    calculate.add(3, 5)

### Advantages

1.  Every Python module has it’s `__name__` defined and if this is `__main__`, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
2.  If you import this script as a module in another script, the **name** is set to the name of the script/module.
3.  Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
4.  if `__name__ == “main”:` is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

## setup.py

The setup script is the centre of all activity in building, distributing, and installing modules using the Distutils. The main purpose of the setup script is to describe your module distribution to the Distutils, so that the various commands that operate on your modules do the right thing.

The `setup.py` file is at the heart of a Python project. It describes all of the metadata about your project. There a quite a few fields you can add to a project to give it a rich set of metadata describing the project. However, there are only three required fields: name, version, and packages. The name field must be unique if you wish to publish your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The version field keeps track of different releases of the project. The packages field describes where you’ve put the Python source code within your project.

This allows you to easily install Python packages. Often it's enough to write:

    python setup.py install

and module will install itself.

Our initial setup.py will also include information about the license and will re-use the README.txt file for the long_description field. This will look like:

    from distutils.core import setup
    setup(
       name='pythonCheatsheet',
       version='0.1',
       packages=['pipenv',],
       license='MIT',
       long_description=open('README.txt').read(),
    )

## Dataclasses

`Dataclasses` are python classes but are suited for storing data objects. This module provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods such as `__init__()` and `__repr__()` to user-defined classes.

### Features

1.  They store data and represent a certain data type. Ex: A number. For people familiar with ORMs, a model instance is a data object. It represents a specific kind of entity. It holds attributes that define or represent the entity.
2.  They can be compared to other objects of the same type. Ex: A number can be greater than, less than, or equal to another number.

Python 3.7 provides a decorator dataclass that is used to convert a class into a dataclass.

python 2.7

    class Number:
        def __init__(self, val):
            self.val = val

    obj = Number(2)
    obj.val

with dataclass

    from dataclasses import dataclass

    @dataclass
    class Number:
        val: int

    obj = Number(2)
    obj.val

### Default values

It is easy to add default values to the fields of your data class.

    from dataclasses import dataclass

    @dataclass
    class Product:
        name: str
        count: int = 0
        price: float = 0.0

    obj = Product("Python")
    obj.name

    obj.count

    obj.price

### Type hints

It is mandatory to define the data type in dataclass. However, If you don't want specify the datatype then, use `typing.Any`.

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from typing import Any

    @dataclass
    class WithoutExplicitTypes:
       name: Any
       value: Any = 42

## 6.1 Inheritance

\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#

# Inheritance allows new child classes to be defined that inherit methods and

# define a child class, Superhero, which inherits the class variables like

# "species", "name", and "age", as well as methods, like "sing" and "grunt"

# from the Human class, but can also have its own unique properties.

# To take advantage of modularization by file you could place the classes above in their own files,

# say, human.py

# To import functions from other files use the following format

# from "filename-without-extension" import "function-or-class"

from human import Human

# Specify the parent class(es) as parameters to the class definition

for i in double_numbers(range(1, 900000000)): \# `range` is a generator. print(i) if i &gt;= 30: break
