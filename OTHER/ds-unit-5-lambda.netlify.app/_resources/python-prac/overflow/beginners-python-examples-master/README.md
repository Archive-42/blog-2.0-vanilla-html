# Beginners-Python-Programs

Basic python CLI programs as examples  
All the examples are useful examples  
These examples are of beginners’ level

Hey guys I wrote these programs when I was just starting up with programming, now I realize that many of ’em feel very un-professional and useless so I decided to go one by one through all and make ’em more useful and professional !

Note: In 2.x versions input isn’t useful , lly , in 3.x versions raw_input isn’t useful. Also, xrange() and other methods are discontinued or changed in 3.x versions of python. Change the keywords accordingly!

    NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS!
    Files Outside Particular Folders/Directories have not been checked yet!
    Files inside, directories offer much elegant code and explaination
