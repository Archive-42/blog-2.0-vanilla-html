<p>Basic python CLI programs as examples<br />
All the examples are useful examples<br />
These examples are of beginners’ level</p>
<p>Hey guys I wrote these programs when I was just starting up with programming, now I realize that many of ’em feel very un-professional and useless so I decided to go one by one through all and make ’em more useful and professional !</p>
<p>Note: In 2.x versions input isn’t useful , lly , in 3.x versions raw_input isn’t useful. Also, xrange() and other methods are discontinued or changed in 3.x versions of python. Change the keywords accordingly!</p>
<pre><code>NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS!
Files Outside Particular Folders/Directories have not been checked yet!
Files inside, directories offer much elegant code and explaination</code></pre>
