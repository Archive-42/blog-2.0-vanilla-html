    <p>
      Outline in writing (no coding–unless you really want to) the parts you
      would have to code up to implement a simple filesystem. The filesystem is
      what keeps track of and organizes files on disk. When you want to read a
      file, the OS must go retrieve the blocks of the file until it has them all
      loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The filesystem would need to store file names and the sizes of the file in
      bytes. Maybe a “created” date.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would also need to store the data in blocks; a file might be made up of
      multiple blocks somehow chained together. The blocks might be spread all
      over the disk (fragmented).
    </p>
    <p>
      When new files are written, they have to go in blocks that aren’t
      currently in-use by other files. How are free blocks tracked?
    </p>
    <p>
      (Assume no subdirectories in this filesystem, and that all files are in
      the same directory.)
    </p>
    <p>
      How would you organize this data, both the information about the file (the
      <em>metadata</em>) and the data of the file itself?
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s no right answer to this problem; there are many kinds of
      filesystems that use many different techniques to get the work done.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a challenging problem. Mentally experiment with different
      approaches of keeping track of the data and figure what works and what
      breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Stretch challenge</strong>: How would you support subdirectories?
