    <h1 id="operating-systems-overview">Operating Systems Overview</h1>
    <p>
      There are three operating systems that are primarily popular on general
      purpose computers - Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two operating systems that are essential for popular
      handhelds–Android and iOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are dozens of UNIX variants for simpler processors available.
      Typically when working with a small dedicated cpu (like an ARM CPU on an
      IoT device), the operating system supported for that device has been
      defined by the manufacturer of the device and is a subset of Linux.
    </p>
    <h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
    <p>
      Original popular OS for consumers, no permissions enabled fast and easy
      development, high performance for games and other user applications.
      Became a difficult model to maintain with the rise of the internet,
      leading to many revisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Backwards compatibility is the hallmark of Windows, which causes endless
      headaches for modern developers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
    <p>
      Started by Linus Torvalds, who was at the time a student of Andrew
      Tanenbaum’s, the Linux kernel is a copy of the MINIX kernel, which had
      been created by his instructor. MINIX is copy of the POSIX, an industry
      standardized system interface that was originally released in 1988. At the
      time there were many variants of UNIX, all limited to mainframe computers
      like VAX and PDP systems. The core of UNIX at this time is POSIX, which is
      the basis for essentially every successful operating system except
      Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are dozens of Linux forks at this time, called distros. Ubuntu is
      the most famous and successful of these, and unless you want to build up a
      career in system administration it is not necessary to learn any others.
      The basics of the Linux operating system depend on a few basic
      philosophies - processes that accept streams of text as input and produce
      streams of text as output (pipes), file descriptors as references to
      device drivers and other hardware (including individual files stored on a
      permanent storage medium), and security enforced by basic access controls
      applied to every component of the system.
    </p>
    <p>Development paradigms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>C and C++ native development.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Management of symbolic and dynamic links via /usr/lib and
          /usr/local/lib and /usr/include and many more. Dependencies in linux
          are stored in files with specific paths, and can either be built
          natively using <code>gcc</code> or loaded using package management.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Technologies you should familiar with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bash and shell scripting</li>
      <li>SSH</li>
      <li>System calls</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Technologies to be secondarily familiar with</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Network programming</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="macos-previously-mac-os-x">macOS (previously Mac OS X)</h2>
    <p>
      macOS is another fork of UNIX, now called Darwin but previously FreeBSD,
      which was created in the 90s by Berkely (Berkeley Software Distribution).
      OS X features a kernel and basic system libraries that are nearly
      identical to Linux, with many small differences. OS X’s graphics layer,
      Cocoa, differs substantially from Linux graphics layers, features much
      greater reliability and consistency, and uniquely supports development in
      Objective-C and Swift.
