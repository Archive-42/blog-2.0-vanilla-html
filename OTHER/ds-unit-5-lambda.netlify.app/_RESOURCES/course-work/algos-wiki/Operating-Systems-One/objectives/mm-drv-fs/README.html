      Memory Management, Drivers, and File Systems, Oh my!
    </h1>
    <h2 id="memory-management">Memory Management</h2>
    <p>
      The operating system is responsible for providing user programs access to
      memory. The operating system creates a stack frame at the beginning of a
      program’s execution and allocates a section of available free memory for
      it to utilize. The program’s memory space begins essentially at 0, and it
      has no knowledge of any memory outside of the memory that has been
      allocated to it by the operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the fundamental attack vectors used in attempting to take
      malicious control of a computer. The operating system is responsible for
      perfectly isolating each process from one another - if a process is able
      to gain access to memory other than what has been assigned to it it will
      be able to hijack the system.
    </p>
    <h2 id="drivers">Drivers</h2>
    <p>
      Drivers combine, assembly language, C code, and interrupt-driven
      programming to provide software control of physical devices. The drivers
      hide the dirty details of talking to the hardware from software
      developers. Then they present a consistent, easy-to-use programming
      interface. For example, a driver might know the details about how to talk
      specifically to an NVIDIA graphics card. Normal programmers don’t need or
      want to know those details. They just want to be able to tell any 3D card
      from any manufacturer how to draw a scene. For that purpose, the driver
      exposes an OpenGL or Direct3D interface that the programmers can use.
    </p>
    <p>
      On general purpose computers like Kaby Lake machines, all drivers are
      written to control hardware on the other side of the PCIx bus. Hardware is
      built with a PCIx bus controlller, and driver commands configure binary
      messages to be sent and retrieved from the hardware over that bus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In smaller systems like IoT and firmware devices, the bus may be a true
      parallel bus that is shared between the CPU and the device. These buses
      are synchronized by the system clock. Drivers on these systems have to
      know how to take control of the hardware device at the hardware level and
      can be written to any degree of specificity.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to write drivers on the PCIx bus or on a parallel bus is a lesson in
      Computer Engineering, not covered here at Lambda School.
    </p>
    <h2 id="file-system">File System</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/filesystems.html"
        >File systems at The Linux Documentation Project.org</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Files are read and written from internal storage using PCIx drivers
      dedicated to controlling hard disks. The operating system keeps a record
      of all of the files in the system, called the File Table.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ve probably heard of the FAT and vFAT filesystems. Linux users are
      more familiar with the <em>ext4</em> filesystem.
    </p>
    <h3 id="file-table-features">File table features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Contiguity</li>
      <li>Redundancy</li>
      <li>Small overhead</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Dozens of specific file systems exist for specialized tasks, as well as
      dozens of general-purpose filesystems.

      Explain the following to someone in class, or in your house, or on the
      phone. If no one is available, any house plant will do.

          If a malicious process had access to the data of another process
          without permission, what are some bad things that could happen?

          If we didn’t have drivers, what would programmers have to do if they
          wanted to communicate with different brands of USB cards?
