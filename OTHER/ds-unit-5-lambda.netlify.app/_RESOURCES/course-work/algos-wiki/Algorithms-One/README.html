    <h1 id="algorithms-one">Algorithms One</h1>
    <p>
      After the invention of the Turing Machine, human computation was proved to
      be equivalent to mechanical computation. Invention quickly moved toward
      building these kinds of machines. Mathematical theorists moved on to the
      question of what kinds of problems can be computed, how to formulate those
      questions, and how difficult they become.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algorithms are a vast subject packed with mathematical specificity - no
      two day study of the subject can enable to you tackle any problem in the
      space. This lesson is to teach you about the challenges and complexities
      in the design, understanding, and implementation of algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of rigorously explaining certain challenging problems, then
      identifying a specific method to finding a correct answer. Primarily an
      academic discipline, nonetheless all of computer science rests on it.
    </p>
    <h1 id="the-basis-of-algorithm-design-countability-and-permutations">
      The basis of algorithm design: Countability and Permutations
    </h1>
    <p>
      The most basic question in algorithm design begins with the countability
      of sets. The set <code>N</code> of integers is countably infinite: All
      negative and positive integers:
      <code>{..., -4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4, ...}</code>. The set <code>R</code> of
      real numbers is uncountably infinite: All numbers that can be expressed as
      fractions:
      <code>{..., -101/10, ..., -1/2, ..., 0/1, ... 1/1, ..., 7/3, ...}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sets are also used to communicate about discrete sets, which is the
      interest of computer science.
      <code
        >let X = ["apple", "cherry", "tomato", "strawberry", "raspberry"]</code
      >
      and <code>let Y = ["up", "down", "left", "right"]</code>. The study of
      algorithms involves identifying the set of elements that make up certain
      specific problems and then exploring that set in search of some solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most basic approach to finding any solution is to exhaustively
      enumerate every permutation of the set in question. Exhaustive enumeration
      provides perfect solutions, but is intractable but for all of the smallest
      datasets. The size of the set Z of a set S with n elements is
      <code>n!</code> - the largest complexity class. :)

    <p>
      A graph is a set of nodes that are connected by edges. Nodes each
      represent information in some state, and edges represent transformations
      of that information into another state. Any problem in computation can
      generally be described as “here is the information we know about the
      problem” as a state and “these are the changes we can apply to the
      information from this state” as an edge. Each node has a number of edges
      leaving it that is known as its “branching factor”. The branching factor
      of graph determines the size of its search space.

      Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The TSP is one of the most famous problems in Computer Science. Imagine a
      map containing <code>n</code> cities that need to be visited in an optimal
      order. This problem is known to be somewhere less than O(n!) and greater
      than O(x^n).
    </p>
    <p>
      TSP is one of the most popular benchmark problems and a great many
      algorithms have been tested against it. For the interest time of time and
      experience, only two algorithms are prescribed in this assignment:
    </p>
    <h3 id="solution-methods">Solution Methods:</h3>
    <h4 id="exhaustive-search-breadth-first-or-depth-first-search">
      Exhaustive search (Breadth-first or Depth-first search)
    </h4>
    <p>
      Exhaustive search is fundamentally the most difficult case: calculate the
      length of every possible path, keeping the shortest. This method is
      guaranteed to return the shortest path, but is intractable for lists of
      cities greater than ~20, as this algorithm is NP-Complete and O(n!). The
      algorithm to exhaustively search involves starting from the first ordered
      list of all cities as integers, then swapping a pair, calculating the
      length of that trip, storing it if <code>l(x) &lt; B</code>, and repeating
      until all swaps have been performed:
    </p>
    <pre><code>Cities: [
{name:&quot;Denver&quot;, x:500, y:500},
{name:&quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, x:300, y:500},
{name:&quot;Cheyenne&quot;, x:500, y:600},
{name:&quot;Santa Fe&quot;, x:500, y:350]
]</code></pre>
    <p>
      The distance between two cities is: distance_between = (city1, city2)
      -&gt; { return Math.sqrt((city1.x - city2.x)^2 + (city.1.y - city2.y)^2))
      }
    </p>
    <p>All 4! permutations of <code>Cities</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>[1,2,3,4] = [Denver, Salt Lake City, Cheyenne, Santa Fe]
[1,2,4,3]
[1,3,2,4]
[1,3,4,2]
[1,4,2,3]
[1,4,3,2]

[2,1,3,4]
[2,1,4,3]
[2,3,1,4]

[3,2,4,1]
[3,4,1,2]
[3,4,2,1]

[4,1,2,3]
[4,1,3,2]
[4,2,1,3]
[4,2,3,1]
[4,3,1,2]
[4,3,2,1]</code></pre>
    <p>Exhaustive Algorithm Psuedo Code:</p>
    <pre><code>best_trip_length = MAX
best_trip = []
for each ordering in the permutations of C:
  current_trip_length = 0
  for each pair in the ordering:
    current_trip_length += distance_between(current_pair)
  if(current_trip_length &lt; best_trip_length)
    best_trip_length = current_trip_length
    best_trip = ordering</code></pre>
    <h4 id="nearest-neighbor-search">Nearest Neighbor search</h4>
    <p>
      Nearest neighbor search (Choose only the nearest neighbor from a given
      city). This algorithm takes a decidedly different approach than exhaustive
      and is only O(n^2). It doesn’t produce the <em>best</em> result, but it
      tends to produce a result that is within 25% of the best result. It is
      neither the fastest nor the “most optimal” of the decideable algorithms,
      but it is easy to implement and understand.
    </p>
    <pre><code>given a list of cities to be visited l
path = []
for each city start in l:
  add start to path
  while(path.length != l.length)
    for each city in l not in path:
      current = distance(city, start);
      if(distance &lt; best_nearest)
        best_nearest_distance = distance
        best_nearest = city
    path.add(best_nearest)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Implement the above two algorithms. Use the short and long city datasets
      provided in this assignment and compare their running times and the length
      and shapes of the paths they return.
