    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      During this sprint, we will introduce you to some very common data
      structures: linked lists, queues, stacks, and binary trees. Additionally,
      we will teach you about searching through these data structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      A basic understanding of and the ability to work with these data
      structures is crucial. These are probably the most common data structures
      you work with, and an excellent working understanding of them is essential
      for you to pass a technical interview.
    </p>
    <h2 id="linked-lists">Linked Lists</h2>
    <p>
      In this module, you will learn all about linked lists. This a crucial data
      structure because they form the basis for many other data structures.
    </p>
    <h2 id="queues-and-stacks">Queues and Stacks</h2>
    <p>
      This module will teach about queues, stacks, and different implementation
      options for both. The queue and stack data structures come up frequently
      during technical interviews and form the basis for necessary traversal
      techniques that we will look at later.
    </p>
    <h2 id="binary-search-trees">Binary Search Trees</h2>
    <p>
      In this module, you will learn about binary tree properties and binary
      search trees. These data structures commonly come up during technical
      interviews, so you need to be comfortable working with them.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tree-traversal">Tree Traversal</h2>
    <p>
      In this module, you will learn about the different tree traversal methods
      and practice using them in algorithmic code challenges.
