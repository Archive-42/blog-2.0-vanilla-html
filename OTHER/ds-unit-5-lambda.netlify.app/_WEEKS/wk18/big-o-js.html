    <h1 id="a-note-on-big-o-notation">A note on Big-O notation</h1>
    <p>
      It’s useful to know how fast an algorithm is and how much space it needs.
      This allows you to pick the right algorithm for the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big-O notation gives you a rough indication of the running time of an
      algorithm and the amount of memory it uses. When someone says, “This
      algorithm has worst-case running time of <strong>O(n^2)</strong> and uses
      <strong>O(n)</strong> space,” they mean it’s kinda slow but doesn’t need
      lots of extra memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Figuring out the Big-O of an algorithm is usually done through
      mathematical analysis. We’re skipping the math here, but it’s useful to
      know what the different values mean, so here’s a handy table.
      <strong>n</strong> refers to the number of data items that you’re
      processing. For example, when sorting an array of 100 items,
      <strong>n = 100</strong>.
    </p>
    <table>
      <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 33%" />
        <col style="width: 33%" />
        <col style="width: 33%" />
      </colgroup>
      <thead>
        <tr class="header">
          <th>Big-O</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><strong>O(1)</strong></td>
          <td>constant</td>
          <td>
            <strong>This is the best.</strong> The algorithm always takes the
            same amount of time, regardless of how much data there is. Example:
            looking up an element of an array by its index.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><strong>O(log n)</strong></td>
          <td>logarithmic</td>
          <td>
            <strong>Pretty great.</strong> These kinds of algorithms halve the
            amount of data with each iteration. If you have 100 items, it takes
            about 7 steps to find the answer. With 1,000 items, it takes 10
            steps. And 1,000,000 items only take 20 steps. This is super fast
            even for large amounts of data. Example: binary search.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><strong>O(n)</strong></td>
          <td>linear</td>
          <td>
            <strong>Good performance.</strong> If you have 100 items, this does
            100 units of work. Doubling the number of items makes the algorithm
            take exactly twice as long (200 units of work). Example: sequential
            search.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><strong>O(n log n)</strong></td>
          <td>“linearithmic”</td>
          <td>
            <strong>Decent performance.</strong> This is slightly worse than
            linear but not too bad. Example: the fastest general-purpose sorting
            algorithms.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><strong>O(n^2)</strong></td>
          <td>quadratic</td>
          <td>
            <strong>Kinda slow.</strong> If you have 100 items, this does 100^2
            = 10,000 units of work. Doubling the number of items makes it four
            times slower (because 2 squared equals 4). Example: algorithms using
            nested loops, such as insertion sort.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><strong>O(n^3)</strong></td>
          <td>cubic</td>
          <td>
            <strong>Poor performance.</strong> If you have 100 items, this does
            100^3 = 1,000,000 units of work. Doubling the input size makes it
            eight times slower. Example: matrix multiplication.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="odd">
          <td><strong>O(2^n)</strong></td>
          <td>exponential</td>
          <td>
            <strong>Very poor performance.</strong> You want to avoid these
            kinds of algorithms, but sometimes you have no choice. Adding just
            one bit to the input doubles the running time. Example: traveling
            salesperson problem.

        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
          <td><strong>O(n!)</strong></td>
          <td>factorial</td>
          <td>
            <strong>Intolerably slow.</strong> It literally takes a million
            years to do anything.

    </figure>
    <p>Below are some examples for each category of performance:</p>
    <p><strong>O(1)</strong></p>
    <p>
      The most common example with O(1) complexity is accessing an array index.
    </p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>let value = array[5]</code></pre>
    <p>Another example of O(1) is pushing and popping from Stack.</p>
    <p><strong>O(log n)</strong></p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>var j = 1
while j &lt; n {
  // do constant time stuff
  j *= 2
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Instead of simply incrementing, ‘j’ is increased by 2 times itself in each
      run.
    </p>
    <p>Binary Search Algorithm is an example of O(log n) complexity.</p>
    <p><strong>O(n)</strong></p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>for i in stride(from: 0, to: n, by: 1) {
  print(array[i])
}</code></pre>
    <p>Array Traversal and Linear Search are examples of O(n) complexity.</p>
    <p><strong>O(n log n)</strong></p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>for i in stride(from: 0, to: n, by: 1) {
var j = 1
  while j &lt; n {
    j *= 2
    // do constant time stuff
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>OR</p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>for i in stride(from: 0, to: n, by: 1) {
  func index(after i: Int) -&gt; Int? { // multiplies `i` by 2 until `i` &gt;= `n`
    return i &lt; n ? i * 2 : nil
  }
  for j in sequence(first: 1, next: index(after:)) {
    // do constant time stuff
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Merge Sort and Heap Sort are examples of O(n log n) complexity.</p>
    <p><strong>O(n^2)</strong></p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>for i  in stride(from: 0, to: n, by: 1) {
  for j in stride(from: 1, to: n, by: 1) {
    // do constant time stuff
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Traversing a simple 2-D array and Bubble Sort are examples of O(n^2)
      complexity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>O(n^3)</strong></p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>for i in stride(from: 0, to: n, by: 1) {
  for j in stride(from: 1, to: n, by: 1) {
    for k in stride(from: 1, to: n, by: 1) {
      // do constant time stuff
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p><strong>O(2^n)</strong></p>
    <p>
      Algorithms with running time O(2^N) are often recursive algorithms that
      solve a problem of size N by recursively solving two smaller problems of
      size N-1. The following example prints all the moves necessary to solve
      the famous “Towers of Hanoi” problem for N disks.
    </p>
    <pre
      class="swift"
    ><code>func solveHanoi(n: Int, from: String, to: String, spare: String) {
  guard n &gt;= 1 else { return }
  if n &gt; 1 {
      solveHanoi(n: n - 1, from: from, to: spare, spare: to)
      solveHanoi(n: n - 1, from: spare, to: to, spare: from)
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p><strong>O(n!)</strong></p>
    <p>
      The most trivial example of function that takes O(n!) time is given below.
    </p>
    <pre class="swift"><code>func nFactFunc(n: Int) {
  for i in stride(from: 0, to: n, by: 1) {
    nFactFunc(n: n - 1)
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Often you don’t need math to figure out what the Big-O of an algorithm is
      but you can simply use your intuition. If your code uses a single loop
      that looks at all <strong>n</strong> elements of your input, the algorithm
      is <strong>O(n)</strong>. If the code has two nested loops, it is
      <strong
        >O(n<sup>2)<strong>. Three nested loops gives </strong>O(n</sup
        >3)</strong
      >, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that Big-O notation is an estimate and is only really useful for
      large values of <strong>n</strong>. For example, the worst-case running
      time for the <a href="Insertion%20Sort/">insertion sort</a> algorithm is
      <strong>O(n^2)</strong>. In theory that is worse than the running time for
      <a href="Merge%20Sort/">merge sort</a>, which is
      <strong>O(n log n)</strong>. But for small amounts of data, insertion sort
      is actually faster, especially if the array is partially sorted already!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find this confusing, don’t let this Big-O stuff bother you too
      much. It’s mostly useful when comparing two algorithms to figure out which
      one is better. But in the end you still want to test in practice which one
      really is the best. And if the amount of data is relatively small, then
      even a slow algorithm will be fast enough for practical use.
