    <h2 id="what-is-oops">2. What is OOPs?</h2>
    <p>
      OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) is a type of programming which is based
      on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual objects
      are grouped into classes. OOPs implements real-world entities like
      inheritance, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows
      binding data and code together.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-use-oops">3. Why use OOPs?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        OOPs allows clarity in programming thereby allowing simplicity in
        solving complex problems
      </li>
      <li>
        Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy
      </li>
      <li>Data and code are bound together by encapsulation</li>
      <li>
        OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential
      </li>
      <li>
        Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve
      </li>
      <li>
        The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing
        the entities to have multiple forms
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-main-features-of-oops">
      4. What are the main features of OOPs?
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
      <li>Polymorphism</li>
      <li>Data Abstraction</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-an-object">5. What is an object?</h2>
    <p>
      An object is a real-world entity which is the basic unit of OOPs for
      example chair, cat, dog, etc. Different objects have different states or
      attributes, and behaviors.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-class">6. What is a class?</h2>
    <p>
      A class is a prototype that consists of objects in different states and
      with different behaviors. It has a number of methods that are common the
      objects present within that class.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-class-and-a-structure">
      7. What is the difference between a class and a structure?
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Class:</strong> User-defined blueprint from which objects are
      created. It consists of methods or set of instructions that are to be
      performed on the objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Structure:</strong> A structure is basically a user-defined
      collection of variables which are of different data types.
    </p>
    <h2 id="can-you-call-the-base-class-method-without-creating-an-instance">
      8. Can you call the base class method without creating an instance?
    </h2>
    <p>Yes, you can call the base class without instantiating it if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a static method</li>
      <li>The base class is inherited by some other subclass</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-class-and-an-object">

      />
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-inheritance">10. What is inheritance?</h2>
    <p>
      Inheritance is a feature of OOPs which allows classes inherit common
      properties from other classes. For example, if there is a class such as
      ‘vehicle’, other classes like ‘car’, ‘bike’, etc can inherit common
      properties from the vehicle class. This property helps you get rid of
      redundant code thereby reducing the overall size of the code.

      11. What are the different types of inheritance?
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Single inheritance</li>
      <li>Multiple inheritances</li>
      <li>Multilevel inheritance</li>
      <li>Hierarchical inheritance</li>
      <li>Hybrid inheritance</li>

    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-hybrid-inheritance">13. What is hybrid inheritance?</h2>
    <p>
      Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple and multi-level
      inheritance.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-hierarchical-inheritance">
      14. What is hierarchical inheritance?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hierarchical inheritance refers to inheritance where one base class has
      more than one subclasses. For example, the vehicle class can have ‘car’,
      ‘bike’, etc as its subclasses.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-limitations-of-inheritance">
      15. What are the limitations of inheritance?
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Increases the time and effort required to execute a program as it
        requires jumping back and forth between different classes
      </li>
      <li>The parent class and the child class get tightly coupled</li>
      <li>
        Any modifications to the program would require changes both in the
        parent as well as the child class
      </li>
      <li>Needs careful implementation else would lead to incorrect results</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-superclass">16. What is a superclass?</h2>
    <p>
      A superclass or base class is a class that acts as a parent to some other
      class or classes. For example, the Vehicle class is a superclass of class
      Car.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-subclass">17. What is a subclass?</h2>
    <p>
      A class that inherits from another class is called the subclass. For
      example, the class Car is a subclass or a derived of Vehicle class.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-polymorphism">
      <strong>18. What is polymorphism?</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Polymorphism refers to the ability to exist in multiple forms. Multiple
      definitions can be given to a single interface. For example, if you have a
      class named Vehicle, it can have a method named speed but you cannot
      define it because different vehicles have different speed. This method
      will be defined in the subclasses with different definitions for different
      vehicles.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-static-polymorphism">19. What is static polymorphism?</h2>
    <p>
      Static polymorphism (static binding) is a kind of polymorphism that occurs
      at compile time. An example of compile-time polymorphism is method
      overloading.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-dynamic-polymorphism">20. What is dynamic polymorphism?</h2>
    <p>
      Runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism (dynamic binding) is a type
      of polymorphism which is resolved during runtime. An example of runtime
      polymorphism is method overriding.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-method-overloading">21. What is method overloading?</h2>
    <p>
      Method overloading is a feature of OOPs which makes it possible to give
      the same name to more than one methods within a class if the arguments
      passed differ.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-method-overriding">22. What is method overriding?</h2>
    <p>
      Method overriding is a feature of OOPs by which the child class or the
      subclass can redefine methods present in the base class or parent class.
      Here, the method that is overridden has the same name as well as the
      signature meaning the arguments passed and the return type.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-operator-overloading">23. What is operator overloading?</h2>
    <p>
      Operator overloading refers to implementing operators using user-defined
      types based on the arguments passed along with it.
    </p>

      />
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-encapsulation">25. What is encapsulation?</h2>
    <p>
      Encapsulation refers to binding the data and the code that works on that
      together in a single unit. For example, a class. Encapsulation also allows
      data-hiding as the data specified in one class is hidden from other
      classes.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-access-specifiers">26. What are ‘access specifiers’?</h2>
    <p>
      Access specifiers or access modifiers are keywords that determine the
      accessibility of methods, classes, etc in OOPs. These access specifiers
      allow the implementation of encapsulation. The most common access
      specifiers are public, private and protected. However, there are a few
      more which are specific to the programming languages.

    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-data-abstraction">28. What is data abstraction?</h2>
    <p>
      Data abstraction is a very important feature of OOPs that allows
      displaying only the important information and hiding the implementation
      details. For example, while riding a bike, you know that if you raise the
      accelerator, the speed will increase, but you don’t know how it actually
      happens. This is data abstraction as the implementation details are hidden
      from the rider.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-to-achieve-data-abstraction">
      29. How to achieve data abstraction?
    </h2>
    <p>Data abstraction can be achieved through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Abstract class</li>
      <li>Abstract method</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-an-abstract-class">30. What is an abstract class?</h2>
    <p>
      An abstract class is a class that consists of abstract methods. These
      methods are basically declared but not defined. If these methods are to be
      used in some subclass, they need to be exclusively defined in the
      subclass.
    </p>
    <h2 id="can-you-create-an-instance-of-an-abstract-class">
      31. Can you create an instance of an abstract class?
    </h2>
    <p>
      No. Instances of an abstract class cannot be created because it does not
      have a complete implementation. However, instances of subclass inheriting
      the abstract class can be created.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-an-interface">32. What is an interface?</h2>
    <p>
      It is a concept of OOPs that allows you to declare methods without
      defining them. Interfaces, unlike classes, are not blueprints because they
      do not contain detailed instructions or actions to be performed. Any class
      that implements an interface defines the methods of the interface.
    </p>

      />
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-virtual-functions">34. What are virtual functions?</h2>
    <p>
      Virtual functions are functions that are present in the parent class and
      are overridden by the subclass. These functions are used to achieve
      runtime polymorphism.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-pure-virtual-functions">
      35. What are pure virtual functions?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pure virtual functions or abstract functions are functions that are only
      declared in the base class. This means that they do not contain any
      definition in the base class and need to be redefined in the subclass.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-constructor">36. What is a constructor?</h2>
    <p>
      A constructor is a special type of method that has the same name as the
      class and is used to initialize objects of that class.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-destructor">37. What is a destructor?</h2>
    <p>
      A destructor is a method that is automatically invoked when an object is
      destroyed. The destructor also recovers the heap space that was allocated
      to the destroyed object, closes the files and database connections of the
      object, etc.
    </p>
    <h2 id="types-of-constructors">38. Types of constructors</h2>
    <p>
      Types of constructors differ from language to language. However, all the
      possible constructors are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Default constructor</li>
      <li>Parameterized constructor</li>
      <li>Copy constructor</li>
      <li>Static constructor</li>
      <li>Private constructor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-copy-constructor">39. What is a copy constructor?</h2>
    <p>
      A copy constructor creates objects by copying variables from another
      object of the same class. The main aim of a copy constructor is to create
      a new object from an existing one.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-use-of-finalize">40. What is the use of ‘finalize’?</h2>
    <p>
      Finalize as an object method used to free up unmanaged resources and
      cleanup before Garbage Collection(GC). It performs memory management
      tasks.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-garbage-collectiongc">
      41. What is Garbage Collection(GC)?
    </h2>
    <p>
      GC is an implementation of automatic memory management. The Garbage
      collector frees up space occupied by objects that are no longer in
      existence.

    <p>
      A variable whose value does not change. It always refers to the same
      object by the property of non-transversity.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-an-exception">45. What is an exception?</h2>
    <p>
      An exception is a kind of notification that interrupts the normal
      execution of a program. Exceptions provide a pattern to the error and
      transfer the error to the exception handler to resolve it. The state of
      the program is saved as soon as an exception is raised.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-exception-handling">46. What is exception handling?</h2>
    <p>
      Exception handling in Object-Oriented Programming is a very important
      concept that is used to manage errors. An exception handler allows errors
      to be thrown and caught and implements a centralized mechanism to resolve
      them.

    <h2 id="what-is-a-try-catch-block">48. What is a try/ catch block?</h2>
    <p>
      A try/ catch block is used to handle exceptions. The try block defines a
      set of statements that may lead to an error. The catch block basically
      catches the exception.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-finally-block">49. What is a finally block?</h2>
    <p>
      A finally block consists of code that is used to execute important code
      such as closing a connection, etc. This block executes when the try block
      exits. It also makes sure that finally, block executes even in case some
      unexpected exception is encountered.
