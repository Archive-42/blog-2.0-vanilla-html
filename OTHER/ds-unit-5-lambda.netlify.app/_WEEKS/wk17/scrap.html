      <em><em>ACCESSIBILITY</em></em> : Relates to web design/coding standards
      and refers to how easy it is for everyone to use your website, including
      people who are visually impaired or in any way physically handicapped, or
      limited by older or less common computers and software. These days with
      the smaller screen sized tablets and smart-phones, accessibility for use
      on all devises is important; especially with the growing number of people
      using smaller screen devices to go online.

      <em><em>ADDRESS BAR</em></em> : The white bar towards the top of your

      <em><em>BACKLINKS</em></em> : Links from other website pages to yours.
      Backlinks are used to increase a site’s popularity with search engines and
      to get more people to visit your site. The quality of a backlink and its
      anchor text is factored into Google’s algorithm when deciding how much
      importance to place on it.

      <em><em>BANDWIDTH</em></em> : It may help if you read “traffic” first, but
      very simply, bandwidth relates to how much a resource is used. An analogy
      would be a freeway. The wider the freeway, the more traffic (users) it can
      handle. The narrower it is, the less people can use it at once (without
      problems). When a website gets a lot of visitors, it will use a lot of
      bandwidth.

      <em><em>BOUNCE</em></em> : When you send an email to someone and it comes
      straight back to you with an error message, it is said to have bounced.
      It’s like the internet version of “return to sender” except it is a
      computer or piece of software automatically sending it back to you, not a
      person. Emails can bounce for many reasons. The most common are: you made
      a spelling or typing error in the address, making the address invalid; the
      person you are sending to. Website, Content, and Design Terminology no
      longer has that email address; the person you are sending to has let their
      mailbox become too full to accept new emails; a piece of software on the
      receiving end thinks that your email is spam or that it includes a virus
      and sends it back to you.

      <em><em>BOUNCE RATE</em></em> : A website’s bounce rate is the percentage
      of people who leave the site from the same page they entered the site,
      without clicking through to any other pages. This can be a good indicator
      of how good a website’s navigation is, as well as an indicator of the

      A common misconception is that a logo design is a business’ brand. To

      <em><em>BROWSER</em></em> : When you visit a website, you are seeing it on
      a browser. Websites look very different in reality to what you see when
      you visit it. Everything is in fact encoded. A browser is the piece of
      software that decodes everything so that what you see is an attractive
      page rather than a lot of coding. Most people use the Microsoft Internet
      Explorer browser, which comes with all Windows software. If you look at
      the top right of your screen right now, just under the “X” you will see a
      little picture. This picture tells you what browser you are using. If the
      picture is a wavy square with smaller squares in red, green, blue and
      yellow, you are using IE (Internet Explorer). If it is something
      different, then you probably know all this already.

      <em><em>CACHE</em></em> : Every time you do anything on your computer, it
      stores this in memory so that the next time you try to do the same thing,
      it happens quicker than having to wait from scratch. The place where it
      stores all this is called the “cache”. The irony is that if your cache
      gets too full, it in fact makes your computer work a lot slower. It’s a
      good idea to empty your cache regularly to keep your computer working

      independent of the site’s content or pages. A content management system

      for people who aren’t programmers, saving on the cost of hiring a

    >
      <em><em>COOKIE</em></em> : A small piece of information that certain
      websites store on your computer when you visit them. Cookies are normally
      harmless and the reasons for using them vary. Sometimes it is to make sure
      that their website loads quickly when you next visit, by drawing the saved
      information from your own computer rather than from the website itself.
      Another use is to track visitors to see how often they come, what they do
      when they come and other information to help with marketing. Cookies are
      also used to track visits from other websites, especially when the site
      you are visiting is paying the other site for advertising space or needs
      to pay a referral fee to the originating website. A cookie can also be
      used to check when you last visited and, if any changes since then, to
      force your browser to refresh so that you see the latest information. The
      downside of cookies is that after you have visited a lot of sites with a
      lot of graphics, your computer will begin to get bogged down with all of
      this in its memory. It’s therefore a good idea to regularly clear the
      cookies from your computer.

      information is not stored on the page, but in a database. Every time
      someone visits a particular page, the information is drawn from the
      database in order to display it on the page. Information can therefore be
      easily cross-referenced and the same information applied in many different
      ways, using formulas and different variables.

      important if you are using something like ADSL to connect to the internet,

      you download anything. The bigger the download, the greater the bandwidth
