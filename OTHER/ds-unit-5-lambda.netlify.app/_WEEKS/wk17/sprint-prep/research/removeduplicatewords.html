      How did they do all that in one line? A solution for the kata: Remove

      I’ve been at it again: solving CodeWars kata then marveling at the
      one-line solutions voted best practice by the CodeWars community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge is to take a string of words with words repeated, then
      return the words without repetition, leaving the words in order of their
      first appearance in the input string.
    </p>
    <p>
      To emphasize how impressed I was to see it solved in one line, here’s my
      solution (which by the way was the same as the solution with the second
      most votes for best practice).
    </p>
    <pre><code>def remove_duplicate_words(s):
    &quot;&quot;&quot; removes duplicate words from a string

    s:   a string of words separated by spaces
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    s = s.split()
    unique = []
    for word in s:
        if word not in unique:
            unique.append(word)
    s = &#39; &#39;.join(unique)


    return s</code></pre>
    <p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>
    <p>And here’s the one-liner:</p>
    <pre><code>def remove_duplicate_words(s):
    return &#39; &#39;.join(dict.fromkeys(s.split()))</code></pre>
    <p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>
    <p>Note: I mean one line of function body.</p>
    <p>
      That’s pretty dense, so I’m going to break it down. I like to start from
      the inside.
    </p>
    <pre><code>s.split()</code></pre>
    <p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>
    <p>
      Note that s is the input string. This expression returns a list of the
      words in the string. By default the .split method splits the string at
      space characters and throws out the spaces.
    </p>
    <p>On to the next step</p>
    <pre><code>dict.fromkeys(s.split())</code></pre>
    <p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>
    <p>
      This step is interesting. It creates a dictionary (more on why a
      dictionary later) with the keys for the dictionary supplied by the words
      in the list of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there’s something missing. Aren’t dictionaries in Python supposed to
      have keys <em>and</em> values? It turns out that when you use
      dict.fromkeys to form a dictionary with no values in the argument, it just
      enters None for each value.
    </p>
    <p>
      To clarify this, here’s what it looks like if you print this a dict formed
      in this manner from the input string s = ‘alpha beta beta gamma gamma
      gamma delta alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta’.<br />
      Here’s the dictionary:<br />
      {‘alpha’: None, ‘beta’: None, ‘gamma’: None, ‘delta’: None}
    </p>
    <p>We’re almost there.</p>
    <pre><code>&#39; &#39;.join(dict.fromkeys(s.split()))</code></pre>
    <p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>
    <p>
      Note the syntax here. It’s calling the method .join on a string with one
      space. Since the argument is a dictionary, this will output the a string
      with words taken from the keys, separated by spaces.<br />
      (Note: I’m not sure why it ignores the values. I tested and it does this
      even if there is a value (like 4) for one of the keys).
    </p>
    <p>
      All that’s left is to return the value of this expression. Note that while
      it might seem more intuitive to do something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>output = &#39; &#39;.join(dict.fromkeys(s.split()))
return output</code></pre>
    <p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>
    <p>
      It’s perfectly legal to do this in one line by putting the expression
      directly after return, as in the one line solution:
    </p>
    <pre><code>return &#39; &#39;.join(dict.fromkeys(s.split()))</code></pre>
    <p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p>
    <p>And there it is.</p>
    <p>
      A further note: you may be wondering: why bother with a dict with empty
      keys? Why not just use a set. To understand this you need to understand
      two things. First: Although the description doesn’t explicitly state this,
      the example makes it clear that the words in the output string need to be
      in the order of their first appearance in the input string. Second: sets
      are unordered but, as of Python 3.6 and continuing into Python 3.7,
      dictionaries are ordered according to insertion order.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now it should be clear why a dictionary was the correct choice, even
      though set would seem the more obvious answer. (And, with a strict reading
      of the challenge description, you could argue that it would be a correct
      solution, but the automated testing functions on CodeWars would beg to
      disagree.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So there you have it: One line to do what took me six. Although my
      function had more documentation, so I give myself points there.
